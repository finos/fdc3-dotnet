.NET Standard 2.0 declarations to implement concrete [FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org/) compatible .NET desktop agents and usage of intents/context.

## Getting Involved

### Using the standard? Let us know

If you are an existing individual or corporate user of the FDC3 standard, we would love to hear from you: just email [fdc3@finos.org](mailto:fdc3@finos.org) with details about how you are using the standard.

- If you'd like to be listed as on the community page, please fill out the [Usage Form](https://share.hsforms.com/1gOo0_A70QqyahOygzryVQg1fux8).
- If listing your logo publicly requires legal evaluation, you can reach out **privately** to the [FDC3 Maintainers](mailto:fdc3-maintainers-private@finos.org).

### Interact with the FDC3 community

#### GitHub

- FDC3 activity primarily happens in this [FDC3 GitHub repository](https://github.com/finos/fdc3). [Watch](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) the repository in order to be notified of new Pull Requests and issues.

#### Slack

- The fastest and more interactive way to connect and ask questions to the FDC3 community is to join the [#fdc3 channel on the FINOS slack](https://finos-lf.slack.com/messages/fdc3/).

#### Email

- If you'd like to receive official updates, and/or you don't have access to Slack, please send an email to [fdc3@finos.org](mailto:fdc3@finos.org). You can join the list by sending an email to [fdc3+subscribe@finos.org](mailto:fdc3+subscribe@finos.org).
- To contact the FDC3 maintainers, send an email to [fdc3-maintainers@finos.org](mailto:fdc3-maintainers@finos.org).

#### Meetings

- Finally, another great way to interact with the community, is to attend the monthly [FDC3 Standard Working Group Meeting](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/issues?q=label%3A%22Standard+WG+Meeting%22) and/or the quarterly [FDC3 General Meeting](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/issues?q=label%3A%22General+Meeting%22).
- Email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) to be added to the meeting invite directly, or find the meeting in the [FINOS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=finos.org_fac8mo1rfc6ehscg0d80fi8jig%40group.calendar.google.com).

#### Need help?

- Email [fdc3@finos.org](mailto:fdc3@finos.org) if you need help getting started in the FDC3 Community.
